(Hint, do not center the data since we want regression through the origin, not through the means of the data.)\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r 5}\nlm(y ~ x -1)\n```\n\n###1.3\n\nDo `data(mtcars)` from the `datasets` package and fit the regression model with `mpg` as the outcome and `weight` as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.\n\n```{r 6}\nlibrary(datasets); data(mtcars)\n```\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r7}\nlm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\n```\n\n###1.4\n\nConsider data with an outcome (Y) and a predictor (X). The standard deviation of the predictor is one half that of the outcome. The correlation between the two variables is .5. What value would the slope coefficient for the regression model with Y as the outcome and X as the predictor?\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r 8 q1.4}\nsy <- 1\nsx <- 1/2*sy\ncor <- 0.5\ncor*sy/sx\n```\n\n###1.5\n\nStudents were given two hard tests and scores were normalized to have empirical mean 0 and variance 1. The correlation between the scores on the two tests was 0.4. What would be the expected score on Quiz 2 for a student who had a normalized score of 1.5 on Quiz 1?\n\n__Solution:__\n```{r q1.5}\n1.5*0.4\n```\n\n###1.6\n\nConsider the data given by the following\n\n```{r n}\nx <- c(8.58, 10.46, 9.01, 9.64, 8.86)\n```\nWhat is the value of the first measurement if x were normalized (to have mean 0 and variance 1)?\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r 10}\nnormx <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)\nnormx[1]\n```\n\n###1.7\n\nConsider the following data set (used above as well). \n\n```{r11}\nx <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)\ny <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)\n```\n\nWhat is the intercept for fitting the model with x as the predictor and y as the outcome?\n\n__Solution:__\n\n``` {r q1.7}\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))\n```\n\n###1.8\n\nYou know that both the predictor and response have mean 0. What\ncan be said about the intercept when you fit a linear regression?\n\n```{r q1.8}\nx <- rnorm(100)\ny <- rnorm(100)\nsummary(lm(x ~ y))\n```\n\n__Solution:__\n\nIt must be/close to 0.\n\n###1.9\n\nConsider the data given by\n\n```{r q1.9}\nx <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)\n```\n\nWhat value minimizes the sum of the squared distances between these points and itself?\n\n__Solution:__\n\n$$∑n_i=(x_i−μ)^2$$\n\n```{r q1.9b}\noptim(mean(x), function(mu) sum((x - mu)^2), method = \"BFGS\")$par\n```\n\n\n\n###1.10\n\nLet the slope having fit Y as the outcome and X as the predictor be denoted as β1. Let the slope from fitting X as the outcome and Y as the predictor be denoted as γ1. Suppose that you divide β1 by γ1; in other words consider β1/γ1. What is this ratio always equal to?\n\n__Solution:__\n\nBeta1  = Cor(Y, X) * SD(Y) / SD(X)\nGamma1 = Cor(X, Y) * SD(X) / SD(Y)\nBeta1/Gamma1 = Cor(Y, X) / Cor(X, Y) * SD(Y)^2 / SD(X)^2\n             = 1 * Var(Y) / Var(X)\n             = Var(Y) / Var(X)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Textbook excercises\n\n",
