(Hint, do not center the data since we want regression through the origin, not through the means of the data.)\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r 5}\nlm(y ~ x -1)\n```\n\n###1.3\n\nDo `data(mtcars)` from the `datasets` package and fit the regression model with `mpg` as the outcome and `weight` as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.\n\n```{r 6}\nlibrary(datasets); data(mtcars)\n```\n\n__Solution:__\n\n```{r7}\nlm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\n```\n\n###1.4 [in progress]\n\nConsider data with an outcome (Y) and a predictor (X). The standard deviation of the predictor is one half that of the outcome. The correlation between the two variables is .5. What value would the slope coefficient for the regression model with Y as the outcome and X as the predictor?\n\ny = x\nsx^2 = 1/2sy^2\ncor(x,y) = 0.5x\n```{r 8}\nset.seed(123)\na <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)\nb <- rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)\nlm(a ~ b)\ncor(a, b)\n```",
