Let the slope from fitting X as the outcome and Y as the predictor be denoted as γ1. Suppose that you divide β1 by γ1; in other words consider β1/γ1. What is this ratio always equal to?\n\n__Solution:__\n\nBeta1  = Cor(Y, X) * SD(Y) / SD(X)\nGamma1 = Cor(X, Y) * SD(X) / SD(Y)\nBeta1/Gamma1 = Cor(Y, X) / Cor(X, Y) * SD(Y)^2 / SD(X)^2\n             = 1 * Var(Y) / Var(X)\n             = Var(Y) / Var(X)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Test 2\n\n###2.1 \nConsider the following data with x as the predictor and y as as the outcome.\n\n```{r 2.1a}\nx <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)\ny <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)\n```\n\nGive a P-value for the two sided hypothesis test of whether β1 from a linear regression model is 0 or not.\n\n__Solution:__\nThe summary command will outline the coefficient of the linear model that we need.\n\n```{r2.1b}\nmyfit <- lm(y ~ x)\nmycoef <- coef(summary(myfit))\nmycoef\n\n# The the pvalue is:\nround(mycoef, 3)[8]\n```\n\n2. \nConsider the previous problem, give the estimate of the residual standard deviation.\n\nThe residual standard deviation is given by $$s_res = √(∑(Y - Y_est)^2/(n - 2))$$\n\n```{r2.2a}\nround(summary(myfit)$sigma, 3)\n```\n\n###2.3 \nIn the mtcars data set, fit a linear regression model of weight (predictor) on mpg (outcome). Get a 95% confidence interval for the expected mpg at the average weight. What is the lower endpoint?\n\n\n4. \nRefer to the previous question. Read the help file for mtcars. What is the weight coefficient interpreted as?\n\n5. \nConsider again the mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (1,000 lbs). A new car is coming weighing 3000 pounds. Construct a 95% prediction interval for its mpg. What is the upper endpoint?\n\n6. \nConsider again the mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (in 1,000 lbs). A “short” ton is defined as 2,000 lbs. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in mpg per 1 short ton increase in weight. Give the lower endpoint.\n\n7. \nIf my X from a linear regression is measured in centimeters and I convert it to meters what would happen to the slope coefficient?\n\n8. \nI have an outcome, Y, and a predictor, X and fit a linear regression model with Y=β0+β1X+ϵ to obtain β^0 and β^1. What would be the consequence to the subsequent slope and intercept if I were to refit the model with a new regressor, X+c for some constant, c?\n\n9. \nRefer back to the mtcars data set with mpg as an outcome and weight (wt) as the predictor. About what is the ratio of the the sum of the squared errors, ∑ni=1(Yi−Y^i)2 when comparing a model with just an intercept (denominator) to the model with the intercept and slope (numerator)?\n\n10. \nDo the residuals always have to sum to 0 in linear regression?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Textbook excercises\n\n",
